# Haskell Interesection of 2 Lines or 2 Planes
Haskell Programming for computing intersection of 2 Lines or 2 Planes.

Please refer to [Intersection of  2 Lines or 2 Planes Formula](IntersectionFormula.pdf)

1. clone the repository
2. open Haskell Compiler and redirect to the project directory.

3. command to execute in Haskell compiler to load the script
-- <b>:load "Intersection_Test.hs"</b>
  
4. To display and compute line intersection output use command
<b>line </b>

5. To display and compute plane intersection output command
<b> plane </b>

Use [Intersection_Test.hs](Intersection_Test.hs), to change Line or Plane coefficients and repeat the above steps from step 2 for computing new intersection result.
